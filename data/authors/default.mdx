## Hi! <Twemoji className="mx-2" emoji="waving-hand" /> I'm Anton Shyrko

I am an active and motivated IT student at the Technical University of Košice,
passionate about back-end development and new technologies.
I have experience working with Java and Python, creating projects like a
"Tic-Tac-Toe" game in Java and a "To-Do List" app in Python using the Tkinter library.
I also work with JavaScript, Node.js,React, and Tailwind CSS, building more advanced web solutions.
One of my key projects was the "Magic Mirror," which uses AI and camera technology to detect health
issues and received positive feedback at university tech expos. As part of a startup team,
I’m developing my skills in project management, teamwork, and full-stack development, aiming
to create solutions that solve real-world problems.


## Why I started this blog?

> For me, it’s a way to improve my skills and share what I’ve learned along the way.

I founded this blog as a means to document and share the knowledge and practical wisdom I've acquired during my journey as a software engineer.

Writing helps me better understand new technologies and ideas, and I hope this blog will also be helpful to other developers exploring similar challenges. <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.
